Create a sleek and modern webpage design with the following specifications:

Header:

Place the text "PALETTE PULSE" in the top-left corner in a clean, minimalist font.
Include a simple "Menu" icon (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner.
Main Content:

Use a soft, off-white background to create a minimalist aesthetic.
Center a bold headline that reads:
"Experience art like never before. A canvas of infinite possibilities."
Use a large, sans-serif font with black text. Ensure the text spans multiple lines with proper spacing for readability.
Overlay parts of the headline with two rectangular image blocks:
The first image on the left should feature a serene, castle-like landscape painting.
The second image on the right should display a sunset over a mysterious, mountainous lake.
Ensure the images partially overlap the text, creating a layered, modern effect.
Footer:

Add a smaller, centered text block beneath the headline:
"Your unique space for an exceptional artistic experience featuring captivating contemporary paintings and masterpieces."
Use a subtle gray font in a smaller size for contrast.
Layout:

Ensure the entire design has clean alignment, modern typography, and ample white space.
Provide a responsive layout that maintains visual hierarchy across devices.
Additional Notes:

Prioritize a professional and artistic feel.
Keep the interface simple and focused on the visual impact of the images and typography.
